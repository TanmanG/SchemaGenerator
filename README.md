# SchemaGenerator

This tool extrapolates XSD files from any XMLs provided to it, chiefly for use as validation in writing XMLs for modding RimWorld.

**Usage:**

  Run through command line by passing the name ("SchemaGenerator.exe") in with an output filename (including the extension .xsd) \[-o "my_file_name.xsd"\], and input directories to the Defs folders to be mapped (wrapped with quotation marks, space delineated) \[-i "C:\\location\\of\\your\\RimWorld\\Data\\Core\\Defs\\"\]. Use -h or --help for a description of other minor features, and check the READ_ME.txt in the latest release for a more specific use example.

**Support:**
